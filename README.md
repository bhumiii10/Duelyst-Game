# Duelyst Game Backend

## Overview
This project is a backend implementation of a simplified single Duelyst match, designed as part of a university team project. The goal was to create a Java-based backend capable of interacting with a provided user interface (UI) to simulate a Duelyst match between a human player and an AI opponent. The solution adheres to specified game rules and requirements.

## Features
- **Core Game Logic**: Implements the game rules, enabling a single match to be played.
- **Game State Tracking**: Tracks and updates the board state, player states, card interactions, and more as the game progresses.
- **Card Logic**: Implements logic for 20 Duelyst cards based on predefined rules.
- **AI Opponent**: Semi-intelligent AI logic to provide a challenging experience for the human player.
- **UI Integration**: Communicates with the provided UI via event messaging and API commands to reflect game state changes.

## Project Phases
1. **System Design**:
   - Produced story cards and class descriptions to define the solution design.
   - Delivered an oral evaluation of the design, contributing to the course grade.
2. **Solution Development**:
   - Developed the backend solution over 5 weeks using Agile Scrum methodology.
   - Conducted weekly sprints with sprint reports to track progress and deliverables.
